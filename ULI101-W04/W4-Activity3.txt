#Activity 3 - umask Command
1. Go to your home directory(/home/username) and make directory "slg_for_uli"
2. Now, change your current directory to this newly created directory(slg_for_uli)
3. Now, Issue a command to check the current umask value for this directory
 Now issue these commands:
4. umask 077
5. mkdir mydir
6. touch mydir/myfile.txt

What would be the permissions for the newly created directory and regular file?
(show your work) - You should be able to reason your answer.

#Activity 3 - Solutions-

3. Command to check current umask value ---> umask (without any arguments)

#Permissions for newly created Directory(mydir): -
1. Since by default, FULL PERMISSION SET for directory is 777, therefore
  permissions assigned for directory = FULL Permission set for directory - current umask value
2. In this case, permissions assigned to mydir = 777-077
3. permissions assigned to mydir= 700 ---> rwx------
    

#Permissions for newly created file(myfile.txt): -
1. Since by default, FULL PERMISSION SET for regular file is 666, therefore
  permissions assigned for regular file= FULL Permission set for regular file - current umask value
2. In this case, permissions assigned to myfile.txt = 666-066
3. permissions assigned to myfile.txt= 600 ---> rw-------

EXPLANATION FOR "myfile.txt"

Note: The files cannot be given execution permissions by default as it can cause a security concern, 
      and Linux systems are pretty much known for their amazing security, so that wouldn’t be good.

Therefore, Linux does not provide execute permissions by default, even if it is specified in the umask. 
As a result, umask value of 077 for files will eventually truncate to 066.
However, for directories, umask value of 077 will remain as it is (i.e 077 ).
