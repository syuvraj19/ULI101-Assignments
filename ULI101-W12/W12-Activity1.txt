Activity 1:

1. Write a Bash Shell script "login.sh" that does the following task in order:

	- Clears the screen

	- Displays "My username is: <YOUR-USERNAME>" (Make sure that you use environment variable to get the username and not a Unix/Linux Command)

	- Display "Other users logged into system are: <LIST OF ALL USERS>" (HINT: use Command Substitution here!!)

	- Prompts for a username and store it in a variable "username". (IMP: Do Not use "echo" command)

	- Prompt for a password and store it in a variable "password" in a single line. (IMP: Must include "echo" command in addition to any other command used)

	- Display "valid user" if username is equals to "admin" and password is equals to "secret". Otherwise Display "invalid user"

#!/bin/bash

# Clears the screen
clear

# Displays the current username using an environment variable
echo "My username is: $USER"

# Displays the list of all users currently logged into the system using command substitution
echo "Other users logged into system are: $(who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq)"

# Prompts for a username and stores it in a variable "username"
read -p "Enter username: " username

# Prompts for a password and stores it in a variable "password"
read -sp "Enter password: " password
echo

# Checks if the entered username and password match "admin" and "secret" respectively
if [[ "$username" == "admin" && "$password" == "secret" ]]; then
    echo "valid user"
else
    echo "invalid user"
